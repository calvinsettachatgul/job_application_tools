### enclose in "" if any spaces in the arguments
### write a template called cover in the same directory
### place __postion __company __reason __skills in the template where you want to perform sed string substitution
### the file will be output to the command line as well as copied to clipboard so you can control-V your text into a form. A cover_log file will also be generated that prints the date along with the arguments for each execution.
